Otra forma de hacerlo:

SELECT DISTINCT c.Name AS Nombre_Ciudad, 
       cl.Language AS Idioma, 
       LEFT(c.Name, 3) AS Tres_Primeras_Letras_Ciudad, 
       LEFT(cl.Language, 3) AS Tres_Primeras_Letras_Idioma
FROM city c
JOIN countrylanguage cl ON LEFT(c.Name, 3) = LEFT(cl.Language, 3)
ORDER BY c.Name;
---
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Paises
FROM country;

SELECT Language, COUNT(*) AS Numero_Registros
FROM countrylanguage
GROUP BY Language
ORDER BY Numero_Registros DESC;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Idiomas
FROM countrylanguage;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Language) AS Total_Idiomas
FROM countrylanguage;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Ciudades
FROM city;

SELECT DISTINCT c.Name AS Nombre_Ciudad, 
       cl.Language AS Idioma, 
       LEFT(c.Name, 3) AS Tres_Primeras_Letras_Ciudad, 
       LEFT(cl.Language, 3) AS Tres_Primeras_Letras_Idioma
FROM city c
JOIN countrylanguage cl ON LEFT(c.Name, 3) = LEFT(cl.Language, 3)
ORDER BY c.Name;

SELECT DISTINCT c.Name AS Nombre_Ciudad, cl.Language AS Idioma_Coincidente
FROM city c
JOIN countrylanguage cl ON LEFT(c.Name, 3) = LEFT(cl.Language, 3)
ORDER BY c.Name;

SELECT c.Name AS Nombre_Ciudad, cl.Language AS Idioma
FROM city c
JOIN countrylanguage cl ON LEFT(c.Name, 3) = LEFT(cl.Language, 3)
ORDER BY c.Name;

SELECT Name AS Nombre_Ciudad
FROM city
WHERE LEFT(Name, 3) IN (
    SELECT LEFT(Language, 3)

)
ORDER BY Name;

SELECT Name AS Nombre_Ciudad
FROM city
WHERE CountryCode IN ('ITA', 'IRK')
ORDER BY Name;

SELECT Code 
FROM country 
WHERE Code LIKE 'I%';

SELECT Name AS Nombre_Ciudad

ORDER BY Name;

SELECT c.Name AS Pais, c.Population AS Poblacion_Pais
