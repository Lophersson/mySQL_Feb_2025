Otra forma de hacerlo:

SELECT DISTINCT c.Name AS Nombre_Ciudad, 
       cl.Language AS Idioma, 
       LEFT(c.Name, 3) AS Tres_Primeras_Letras_Ciudad, 
       LEFT(cl.Language, 3) AS Tres_Primeras_Letras_Idioma
FROM city c
JOIN countrylanguage cl ON LEFT(c.Name, 3) = LEFT(cl.Language, 3)
ORDER BY c.Name;
